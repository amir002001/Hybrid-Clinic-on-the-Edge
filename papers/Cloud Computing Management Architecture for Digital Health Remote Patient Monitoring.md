	*  ML is still being done in cloud. Yet it is being used for [[Remote Patient Monitoring]]
3. Chronic diseases responsible for 70% of deaths globally
4. no need to upload data to cloud continuously.
	1. only abnormal data
5. Patient raw data stays at home!
6. both imaging and time series modules can be implemented at home
7. RPM with ML on edge is viable.
8. Since ultrasounds give false positives, it needs a healthcare team to make a decision
9. By using SSL with ultrasound they measured COVID-19 conditions
10. ECG wearables deployed to detect abnormalities.
	1. Detection done on edge as well with no need to transfer data to cloud
