4. Limitations:
	1.  The smart hand wristed devices will give the update in a bit of time.
	2. Restricted battery power
	3. Watch arrangement: Proper situating of the gadget is needed to guarantee that the information gathered is precise. The sensors installed in keen watches will work effectively just when the watch is in touch with the skin. Inappropriate arrangements of the gadget may prompt inaccurate outcomes.
	4. Security and protection - Data security, exactness are significant difficulties that must be tended to appropriately while planning a savvy.
5. Future goals: in order to improve the process’ efficiency and accuracy. The creation of an algorithm is mostly focused on increasing the process’s speed and storing of data.
