# Platt Scaling

Date: 2022-04-02

## Description
In machine learning, Platt scaling or Platt calibration is a way of **transforming the outputs of a classification model** into a **probability distribution over classes**. The method was invented by John Platt in the context of support vector machines, replacing an earlier method by Vapnik, but can be applied to other classification models. Platt scaling works by fitting a logistic regression model to a classifier's scores.
