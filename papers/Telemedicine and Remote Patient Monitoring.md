## Paper Main Points
1. Despite the slow growth of interactive and noninteractive telemedicine, technological development continues, and many new applications are under study.
2.  Remote patient monitoring programs, especially those based on store-andforward technologies, are appealing because **they are relatively inexpensive**, **increasingly convenient for patients and providers**, and have the **potential to cut the costs of care while improving outcomes**. **Medicare and other insurer reluctance to cover telemedicine has slowed its dissemination**, but recent years have seen progressive, though limited, steps to *extend reimbursement*.
3. **Physician disinterest has been a factor**, but this too may change as physicians become comfortable with e-mail, the Internet, and other computer uses, and as telemedicine vendors and advocates devise more convenient technology and helpful applications. 
4. Important questions regarding the medical and cost-effectiveness of remote monitoring and other telemedicine applications need further evaluation. 
5. Nonetheless, experience suggests that **telemedicine will continue to evolve slowly but steadily**, as research clarifies its benefits, limitations, and costs.
