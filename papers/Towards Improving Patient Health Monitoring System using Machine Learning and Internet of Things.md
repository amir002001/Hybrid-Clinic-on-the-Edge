2. Again uses cloud based approach.
3. The proposed work provides a better way of monitoring the patient’s health system. 
4. It mainly focuses on patient monitoring using ML, IoT and cloud services. ML is used to improve the decision accuracy. Further, the system can be used as smart real-time patient monitoring system enabled with IOT to monitor the patient’s important vital parameters such as body temperature, blood pressure, heartbeat rate and Oxygen level. 
5. Appropriate medications are suggested based [14] on the provided results. This system sends the collected data to the doctor for consulting, in case of any abnormality, through Cloud. It minimizes the costs in health monitoring and it enables the patient’s to make use of available medical facilities. 
6. Furthermore, the work will assist doctors in easily accessing patient data and can assist doctors and nurses in epidemic situations such as covid, as raw medical data can be [16] analysed in a very short time. In the future, wearable sensor technology based combined with tele medicine may be employed for remote health monitoring.
