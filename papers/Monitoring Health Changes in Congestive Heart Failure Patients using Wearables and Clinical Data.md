## Paper Main Points
1. presented methods for **tracking the health status of a wide spectrum of CHF patients**.
2. By applying **deep learning** to clinical records for critical patients in hospital, we can **identify the patients with the highest risk** of poor medical outcomes. 
3. This system is able to represent the semantics of unstructured clinician notes, revealing information that is likely not included in the structured data considered by most intelligent record monitoring systems. The network can also be easily adapted to predict medical diagnoses, prescribed medicine, or other relevant clinical information. 
4. For CHF patients living at home, we have introduced unobtrusive wearable monitoring systems to track changes in health over time.
5. For CHF patients at risk of health exacerbations, **remote monitoring can often save lives**, but clinicians do not have the resources to track large populations of remote patients. Compared to other tele-health systems, wrist mounted wearables also have the advantage of allowing us to track a subjects response to physical activity, a vital indicator of cardiac health that is not tracked by the majority of remote monitoring systems. 
6. Taken *collectively*, intelligent monitoring of high risk CHF patients offers us opportunities **to reduce medical costs**, improve outcomes, and **avoid unnecessary health exacerbations**.  
7.  As electronic medical data becomes more and more prevalent, it will become increasingly necessary to supply clinicians with sophisticated tools to help them track the highest risk populations of patients.
