## Paper Main Points
1. Developed and validated several machine learning-based models for primary lower extremity arthroplasty that preoperatively predict patient-specific, risk adjusted value metrics, including cost, length of stay, and discharge disposition, to provide improved expectation management, preoperative planning, and potential financial arbitration. 
3. Additionally, leveraged passive, ubiquitous mobile technologies to build a small data registry of human movement surrounding TKA that permits remote patient monitoring to evaluate therapy compliance, outcomes, opioid intake, mobility, and joint range of motion.
4. The rapid rate with which we are acquiring and storing continuous data, whether passively or actively, demands an advanced processing approach: machine learning. 
5. Although machine learning remains a subset of AI, the dissociation between man and the machine is a concept we must begin to embrace as a profession and subsequently harness to our benefit. 
6. By carefully studying machine learning techniques (ie, MLAL) and adapting them into our clinical workflow and systemic infrastructure,we maybe successful in achieving “high performance medicine.” For orthopedics, and high volume subspecialties like arthroplasty in particular, this means remaining at the forefront in knowledge of the strengths and limitations of these evolving technologies that most certainly will directly impact our field.
