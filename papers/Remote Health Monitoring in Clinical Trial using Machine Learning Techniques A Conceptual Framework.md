## Paper Main Points
1. Uses physiological data from wearable device
2. Uses a [[Support Vector Machine]] and an Artificial Neural Network as experimental analysis for [[Remote Patient Monitoring]]
3. Finds out whether participants are fit, unfit, or undecided for the research.
4. At the core it does data analytics and prediction
5. Uses a preprocessed dataset to train and test AI
6. Data is sent to server to process
7. Lack of data verification from face-to-face methods brings need for IoT devices
8. Using ML reduces mortality rate and time spent in hospital
9. Their process looks like this:
	1. Use biobeat to gather 6 types of physiological data
	2. Process the data and feed it to the ANN and SVM
	3. Deploy more biobeat sensors and stream data to a server for analysis.
	4. In case of an event detected, act


## Topics
1. [[Supervised vs unsupervised machine learning]]
2. [[noise and outlier removal]]
3. [[Biobeat Wearable Device]]
4. [[Remote Patient Monitoring]]

## Questions
- What is an ANN?
- What is an SVM?
- What physiological data can BioBeat gather
- How is data noise and outliers removed?
- What other IoT devices can be used?
