## Description
Random forests or random decision forests is an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks that **operates** by **constructing a multitude of [[decision trees]]** at **training time**. For *classification* tasks, the output of the random forest is the class *selected by most trees*. For *regression* tasks, the *mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned*. **Random decision forests correct for decision trees' habit of overfitting to their training set**.â€Š Random forests **generally outperform decision trees**, but their accuracy is lower than gradient boosted trees. However, data characteristics can affect their performance.
