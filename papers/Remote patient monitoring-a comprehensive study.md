## Paper Main Points
1. Advantages of RPM:
	1.  early and real-time detection of illnesses,
	2.  ability to con- tinuously monitor patients, prevention of worsening of ill- nesses and untimely deaths,
	3.  cost reduction in hospitaliza- tions,
	4.  reduce the number of hospitalizations, obtain more accurate readings while permitting usual daily activities for patients
	5. , improve efficiency in healthcare services by utiliz- ing communication technology,
	6.  emergency medical care,
	7.  service for patients with mobility issues,
	8.  emergency care for traffic accidents and other injuries and usage of non-invasive medical interventions.
2.  Basic elements of a remote monitoring system are: 
	1. data acquisition system, 
	2. data processing system, 
	3. end-terminal at the hospital
	4. the communication network
3. A most common form of these sensors used in with-contact methods are wireless sen- sor networks (WSN). These could be further categorized as wireless body area networks (WBAN), body area networks (BAN) or personal area networks (PAN).
4. Most common data are 
	1. Electrocardiogram (ECG),
	2. Electroencephalogram (EEG),
	3.  heart beats and respiration rate
	4. , oxygen volume in blood or pulse oximetry
	5. , signals from the nervous system
	6. , blood pressure,
	7.  body/skin temperature
	8.  blood glucose level. 
	9. In addition to these, sometimes, weight of the patient, level of activity of the patient and sleep data are collected.
 5. For the security in the communication and net- work level, secure routing protocols, cipher based algorithms and digital signature usage are presented. For the transmis- sion of information beyond the personal area network, the paper suggests data encryption, data integrity, freshness protection and authentication. In Sawand et al.
 6. Really good details for per-disease systems
