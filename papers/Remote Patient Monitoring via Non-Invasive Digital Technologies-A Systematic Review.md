## Paper Main Points
1. Literature review of RPM based papers
2. Limitations:
	1. These studies are unlikely to impact the overall findings due to the descriptive nature of the results. In addition, the majority of studies were exploratory or pilot designs, with a high degree of variability in the objectives, populations, and outcomes reported; therefore, the information extracted was limited to broad categorization, subject to prespecified definitions, to assess commonality and trends. 
	2. Many of the studies included in the systematic review enrolled relatively small patient populations; future clinical trials should assess the sample size required to have an adequately powered design and allow for a more generalizable population to assess the effectiveness of RPM technology on the outcomes of interest. 
	3. In addition, the majority of the included studies reported short trial durations; however, to accurately assess the effectiveness of these technologies, the duration should align with the study objectives and clinical outcomes assessed (e.g., readmission rates). Discretion was used with the ‘‘feedback loop/end user’’ variable as this was not clearly described in many of the articles; however, we still felt it was an important aspect of these interventions and highly relevant to their overall value in healthcare.
	4. Many of the studies included only descriptive results; lack of robust measurement on the benefit of RPM on patient outcomes and care delivery was demonstrated. 
	5. In terms of implementation, most studies did not report whether the data was ultimately added to the health system records, as previously stated this may be due to the exploratory nature of these studies.
3. Despite its potential, the rapid development of technological capabilities in the healthcare field has outpaced the capacity to implement many novel RPM interventions into real-world practice.
4. Hence, scant evidence demonstrating improved health outcomes with noninvasive RPM interventions is available and even fewer studies have demonstrated any cost benefit. 
5. Based on this systematic review, there is a key trend toward using multicomponent interventions for the monitoring of chronic conditions in older populations. 
6. Further research utilizing robust study designs is needed to assess the efficacy and value of RPM technology for decision makers, developers, researchers, clinicians, and investors. 
7. This study will help decision makers better understand the current state of evidence available in peer-reviewed literature and assist in the planning of future studies that could address the existing gaps identified in this systematic review. 
8. Large-scale implementation is required to confirm the benefits of RPM across sectors and populations in the health systems and identify the ‘‘optimal’’ patient for maximum utility of RPM. 
9. Barriers to implementation should also be assessed, including provider training, data reliability, security, and incorporation of RPM data into routine care.
