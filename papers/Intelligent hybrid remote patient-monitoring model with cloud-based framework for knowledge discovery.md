## Paper Main Points
1. AAL systems much needed
	1. More elderly
	2. Less staff to take care of them
	3. Chronic diseases also a big part
2. Increase in use of wearables and IoT devices
3. Traditional health care assistant (HCA) systems depend on standalone applications on a local server or handheld device, which are always customised for a specific patient suffering from a particular disease based on a set of generic rules . These systems do not have flexible generic architectures to facilitate the monitoring of different patients suffering from vari- ous diseases. Therefore, some studies have proposed context-aware AAL systems for processing big data to extract knowledge regarding patient health status in real time  . 
4. Recently proposed cloud-based architectures depend entirely on the cloud for classifying patient health status. This means the patient is at risk **when the internet connection is interrupted** or a problem occurs in the cloud system . Additionally, the performance of these models has been evaluated over imbalanced datasets using only accuracy as a met- ric, which yields misleading results. Furthermore, previous studies did not adopt sampling methods designed to process imbalanced datasets.
5. Primary motivations:
	1. The need to **integrate generic and personalised medical rules**, which are designed **by medical experts** to be exploited **during the implementation of intelligent personal medical assistants** that are aware of the individual differences between patients, which **helps to minimise false alarms**. 
	2. The need for developing an intelligent **hybrid model** that utilises two modes to classify patient health status if the connection to the cloud is lost or the internet is disconnected. A hybrid model benefits from the advantages of **both local** and **cloud-based architectures**, while avoiding their disadvantages. 
	3. The need for building a model that addresses the shortcomings in previous models in terms of **handling imbalanced datasets**.
6. studies on patient-monitoring models using mobile devices, but these models have encountered many obstacles, such as their **inability to handle big datasets** and a **reliance on general medical rules**. Models that rely on generic medical rules and ignore the ambient circumstances of vital sign readings are **prone to failure** and often **produce false alarms**

8. Results:
	1. The proposed framework has succeeded in accommodating and analysing big data generated by continuous patient monitoring in real time.
	2.  Smart hospitals can adopt the proposed architecture to monitor their patients in their homes in real time. 
	3. The proposed model utilises the power of clouds for storage and computation. Additionally, a local module that monitors the patient with the same efficiency in the event of internet interruption or a failure in the cloud system has been implemented. 
	4. Our work has led us to conclude that the proposed model is fast, accurate, and fault-tolerant when it comes to monitoring patients with BP disorders and predicting their health status with high precision and minimal false alerts.
	5. The findings of this study indicate that using sampling techniques in parallel via Spark increases the accuracy of classification and minimises overall error rate, particularly for minority classes (emergency class).
	6. The proposed technique achieved higher speed, better accuracy, and higher F-measure than previously proposed systems that depend on MapReduce and association rules without handling imbalanced datasets. 
	7. The importance of developing a local module that simulates the capabilities of a cloud module to preserve patient life in the event of internet interruption or any defect in the cloud system has been proved.
	8. Future work will concentrate on the implementation of this framework for different diseases and additional context domains.
