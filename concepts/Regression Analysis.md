# Regression Analysis

Date: 2022-04-02

## Description
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for **estimating the relationships** between a **dependent variable** (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable) **and one or more independent variables** (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features'). The **most common form** of regression analysis is **[[linear regression]]**, in which **one finds the line** (or a more complex linear combination) that **most closely fits the data** according to a specific mathematical criterion.
