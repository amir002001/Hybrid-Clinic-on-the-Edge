4. needed because there weren't enough tests and patients were contagious!
5. The program repurposed an old tool to deliver RPM for COVID
6. Between March 18 and April 20, 2020, 3701 patients were offered the COVID-19 RPM program. Of those who activated the system, 1496 patients (62% women; median 38 years of age) completed the program, and 757 are currently active. The overall activation rate was 61.2%
7.  10 770 patient check-ins within the RPM
8.  Overall, we were able to quickly and effectively implement an RPM program by repurposing an existing third-party application, and rapidly developed a resident and student rotation to staff it.
