# Multi Task Learning

Date: 2022-04-01

## Description
Multi-task learning (MTL) is a subfield of machine learning in which **multiple learning tasks** are solved **at the same time**, while exploiting commonalities and differences across tasks. This can result in **improved learning efficiency** and **prediction accuracy** for the task-specific models, when compared to training the models separately. Early versions of MTL were called "hints"
