# Linear Classification

Date: 2022-04-02

## Description
In the field of machine learning, the goal of statistical classification is to use an object's characteristics to identify which class (or group) it belongs to. A linear classifier achieves this by **making a classification** decision based on the **value of a linear combination** of the characteristics. An object's characteristics are also known as **[[feature values]]** and are typically presented to the machine in a vector called a [[feature vector]]. Such classifiers work well for practical problems such as *document classification*, and more generally for **problems with many variables** (features), **reaching accuracy levels comparable to non-linear classifiers** while **taking less time** to train and use.
